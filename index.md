# How to Pray

In the broadest sense, to pray is to talk to God. 
The term to pray is now often used to refer to religious prayers: to commune with a deity that we believe in. 
While the rituals and conventions of prayer may vary widely, the intention is the same--to renew our spiritual connection with God Almighty.

## Why should we pray?
> Prayer moves the hands that move the world.

Says it all, does it not?  Prayer is the key to the heart of God. Prayer is the only way to a real and personal relationship with God.  

Here are some reasons why we should pray.

* Pray and acknowledge that God is Sovereign and Almighty.
* Pray because it is from God that we receive everything. So thank God for all the blessings.
* Pray confessing our sins and asking God for forgiveness.
* Pray for understanding and wisdom.
* Pray that God's will be done in each of our lives. Follow God's path because that is best.


## How do we prepare to pray?

1. Find a quiet spot to pray.
2. Have a fixed time daily to talk to God deeply without distractions.
3. Read God's word and meditate.
4. Fill our minds with the good things God has given to us in the days gone by.
5. Have faith that God will give us what we need, if it is pleasing to God, and if God thinks we need it.

## How do we pray?

Prayer is communing with God. Both God and us talk to each other. We can pray in various ways - through singing, through dance, through just shouting it aloud, and through tears as well. 
We can pray in whatever language we want. God understands all languages. Remember, God is our creator. God does not look at mere words, but looks deep in our hearts. God examines hearts. 
And this is why God understands everything, even if we cannot find the words to pray.

If you want to pray, here is a guideline to follow:

* **A**doration - Praise God for being Almighty and Sovereign. God is in control of everyone and everything. We are nothing compared to God.
* **C**onfession - Tell God we are sorry for the myriad sins we commit each day. Yes, even an act such as thinking about hurting someone, is a sin in God's sight. Ask for God's forgiveness and Grace.
* **T**hanksgiving - God created everyone and everything. God provides all we need. Every blessing is from God. Therefore, it is our moral duty to thank God each moment.
* **S**upplication - Ask God for what we need. Big or small, God is powerful to grant it, IF God thinks we should have it. 

We can easily remember this guideline by the word _ACTS_.

God wants us to talk to Him. He wants to commune with us because He created us, knows everything about us, and loves us. Be truthful with God. Its OK to pray even when we are angry, upset or discouraged. 
He understands. He comforts us then if only we pray.

Pray not just because we need something, but because we have a moral duty to be thankful to God for the blessings He loads us with, each day. 

>> Thank you Lord for your blessings on me.
